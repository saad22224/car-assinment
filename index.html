                    <h3>From Road to Race</h3>
                    <p>The Porsche 911 GT3 RS represents the pinnacle of Stuttgart's racing DNA. Based on the iconic 911 platform with roots dating back to 1963, the GT3 RS variant bridges the gap between road-legal performance and track-focused engineering, embodying Porsche's motorsport philosophy of "Win on Sunday, Sell on Monday".</p>

                    <h3>Evolution Timeline</h3>
                    <p><strong>1999:</strong> First generation 996 GT3 introduced, establishing the GT3 lineage as the naturally aspirated, track-oriented variant of the 911.</p>

                    <p><strong>2018:</strong> 991.2 GT3 RS unveiled featuring a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six engine producing 520 HP, rear-wheel steering, and aggressive aerodynamics with magnesium roof and carbon fiber components.</p>

                    <p><strong>2022:</strong> 992 GT3 RS launched with revolutionary aerodynamics including swan-neck rear wing, active front diffuser elements, and extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic). Power increased to 525 HP with 9,000 RPM redline.</p>

                    <p><strong>2023-2024:</strong> Continuous development focused on GT3 racing variants with enhanced cooling systems, optimized weight distribution, and FIA-compliant safety structures. Racing versions developed by Porsche Motorsport for global GT3 competition.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
                    <p>The GT3 RS features a race-derived 4.0L naturally aspirated flat-six engine, seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission, rear-axle steering, and revolutionary aerodynamics generating up to 409 kg of downforce at 200 km/h. Lightweight construction achieves approximately 1,450 kg through extensive use of carbon fiber and magnesium components (Porsche AG, 2024).</p>

                    <h3>The Cathedral of Speed</h3>
                    <p>Located in the Belgian Ardennes, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps is one of motorsport's most iconic
                        venues. First used for racing in 1921, the circuit has hosted countless legendary moments across
                        Formula 1, endurance racing, and GT championships. Porsche has achieved remarkable success here, with numerous victories in both prototype and GT racing.</p>

                    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
                    <p>Originally a 15km triangle of public roads connecting the towns of Spa, Malmedy and Stavelot, the circuit was redesigned in 1979 to its current 7.004km
                        configuration for safety reasons. The circuit remains the longest on the F1 calendar and is renowned for its
                        elevation changes of 105 meters, high-speed corners, and unpredictable Ardennes weather that can see rain on one part of the track while remaining dry elsewhere (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, 2024).</p>

                    <h3>Track Layout</h3>
                    <p><strong>Iconic Corners:</strong> Eau Rouge/Raidillon complex - a legendary uphill left-right-left
                        sequence taken at over 260 kph; Pouhon - a challenging 180-degree double-apex left-hander requiring precise entry; Blanchimont - a fearsome flat-out sweeping left corner taken at over 300 kph demanding commitment and aerodynamic stability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The 7.004 km circuit features 19 corners with significant elevation changes creating unique challenges for setup and driving. The fast-flowing nature demands high downforce for corners like Pouhon while requiring low drag for long straights like Kemmel. Weather conditions add another dimension, with the famous "Spa weather" capable of changing lap by lap (FIA World Endurance Championship, 2024).</p>

                    <p><strong>GT3 Racing:</strong> Spa hosts the prestigious Total 24 Hours of Spa, the crown jewel of
                        the GT World Challenge Europe season and one of the world's greatest GT races, attracting over 65 GT3 entries annually from manufacturers worldwide including Porsche, which has won the event multiple times.</p>

                        <h3>Automotive Design Student</h3>
                        <p>I am Abdulla Al-Derham, a passionate automotive design student with a deep interest in
                            motorsport engineering and aerodynamics. My fascination with GT racing stems from the
                            perfect blend of road car DNA and track-focused performance engineering, and Porsche represents the pinnacle of this philosophy.</p>

                        <p>The Porsche 911 GT3 RS represents everything I admire in modern performance engineering: the preservation of naturally aspirated engine character in an era of forced induction, revolutionary aerodynamics developed through computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing, and the relentless pursuit of the perfect balance between road usability and track capability. The flat-six engine's 9,000 RPM scream is automotive poetry.</p>

                        <p>Spa-Francorchamps holds special significance as it demands respect for both mechanical setup and driver skill. The circuit's unique combination of high-speed sections like Blanchimont and technical sequences like the Pouhon-Campus complex makes
                            it the ultimate testing ground for GT3 machinery. Porsche's success at Spa, including multiple 24 Hours victories, demonstrates the brand's engineering excellence.</p>

                        <p>Through this project, I've explored Porsche's seven-decade evolution from the 356 to today's technologically advanced GT3 RS, examining how Stuttgart's engineers have maintained the core 911 philosophy while integrating cutting-edge materials science, active aerodynamics, and lightweight construction. The livery design process has deepened my understanding of motorsport branding, sponsor integration, and how visual design can communicate engineering excellence and racing heritage simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>This project represents my passion for the intersection of automotive design, aerodynamic engineering, and motorsport heritage - areas where Porsche continues to set the benchmark for the entire automotive industry.</p>
